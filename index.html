        <h2>Revision Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Learning this course was mostly easily, I had previous skill to build upon with my experience in C++ and Python, but of course I had to still learn a new language.
            Over the course of the unit I learned a lot. We of course started with just like an index page that links to other things, which of course you can see is very simple if you look at the code.
            Just a ref, header, body, and nav to other files. Then with the prototype I learned the most basic things within HTML. Tables, lists, and displaying images. Most of this is going to be about how I learned
            more about HTML. Flexbox froggy and CSS Diner I say couldn't really teach me much. I like doing my own thing and not being limited to a website's engine. The same with my python's class with the dog stuff.
            I mean it teaches you the basics, but the prototype assignment kinda taught me a lot about the basics. The CSS Demo was a lot. It was like combining two languages, of course having to learn a new one taught
            can style my HTML code. Of course this was early on into my coding, so I combined the CSS within the HTML. With new learning like sidebars and blockquotes to incorporate new ways to display text. Positioning
            lab was just further expanding, well, my ability to figure out and position things. The logo stuff of course wasn't HTML. It was mostly expanding upon my previous gimp and photoshop skills.
            The mars rover project was of course the final test of everything i've learned into testing. Classes, sections, articles, footers, all kinda new things.
            Don't know what I would change differently on the learning process. I learned and I did the things.
            This website is very concise and easy to read. I quickly learned about NASA rovers after reading through everything, I liked the pictures and how they were. 
            The contact-emails at the bottom of the page were reminiscent of a professional research website, even if they are just examples. My only issue with this website is the missing icons at the top-left of the page, it feels out of place.
            This was the feedback I received for the website. It was of course an easy fix to change the nasa logo from svg format to png. It showed up on my PC on github pages, but for other people it didn't.

        <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <p>
            Progressive enhancement is very easy to describe as the article puts up. It is the perspective to put your content first, instead of trying to make the website future proof for better devices, and
            leaving old devices in more or less the dust. It's a way better way of designing a website. There's no point to your website if it's just pretty and stuff and works. The only thing that brings people
            to websites is content. Either through videos like youtube, up to date news like news websites, or asking and answering questions like forums. They need to host a REAL reason to come.
